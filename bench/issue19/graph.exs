# Run the identical script against baseline and optimized dependencies.
# Compilation/setup and explicit GC are outside timing. No concurrent runs.

# Query loops hold selected degree at one while unrelated history grows.
# A single relabel starts from the same immutable graph on every repetition.
# consume_all changes n distinct edges and retains the resulting history.
