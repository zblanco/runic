defmodule Multigraph do
  @moduledoc """
  This module defines a graph data structure, which supports directed and undirected graphs, in both acyclic and cyclic forms.
  It also defines the API for creating, manipulating, and querying that structure.

  As far as memory usage is concerned, `Multigraph` should be fairly compact in memory, but if you want to do a rough
  comparison between the memory usage for a graph between `libgraph` and `digraph`, use `:digraph.info/1` and
  `Multigraph.info/1` on the two graphs, and both results will contain memory usage information. Keep in mind we don't have a precise
  way to measure the memory usage of a term in memory, whereas ETS is able to give a more precise answer, but we do have
  a fairly good way to estimate the usage of a term, and we use that method within `libgraph`.

  The Multigraph struct is structured like so:

  - A map of vertex ids to vertices (`vertices`)
  - A map of vertex ids to their out neighbors (`out_edges`),
  - A map of vertex ids to their in neighbors (`in_edges`), effectively the transposition of `out_edges`
  - A map of vertex ids to vertex labels (`vertex_labels`), (labels are only stored if a non-nil label was provided)
  - A map of edge ids (where an edge id is simply a tuple of `{vertex_id, vertex_id}`) to a map of edge metadata (`edges`)
  - Edge metadata is a map of `label => weight`, and each entry in that map represents a distinct edge. This allows
    us to support multiple edges in the same direction between the same pair of vertices, but for many purposes simply
    treat them as a single logical edge.

  This structure is designed to be as efficient as possible once a graph is built, but it turned out that it is also
  quite efficient for manipulating the graph as well. For example, splitting an edge and introducing a new vertex on that
  edge can be done with very little effort. We use vertex ids everywhere because we can generate them without any lookups,
  we don't incur any copies of the vertex structure, and they are very efficient as keys in a map.

  ## Multigraphs

  When `multigraph: true` is passed to `Multigraph.new/1`, an edge adjacency index (`edge_index`) is maintained
  alongside the standard graph structure. This index partitions edges by a key derived from a `partition_by`
  function (defaulting to `Multigraph.Utils.by_edge_label/1`, which partitions by edge label).

  The index structure is `%{partition_key => %{vertex_id => MapSet.t(edge_key)}}`, enabling O(1) map-access
  retrieval of edges by partition, avoiding O(E) scans over all edges.

  Query functions such as `edges/2`, `out_edges/3`, and `in_edges/3` accept `:by` and `:where` options
  to filter edges by partition or predicate. Traversal and pathfinding algorithms (`Multigraph.Reducers.Bfs`,
  `Multigraph.Reducers.Dfs`, `dijkstra/4`, `a_star/5`, `bellman_ford/3`) also accept a `:by` option to
  restrict traversal to edges in specific partitions.

  ## Edge Properties

  Edges support an arbitrary `properties` map (default `%{}`) for storing additional metadata beyond
  weight and label. Properties can be set via `add_edge/4` and are preserved through all graph operations.

  Creates a new graph using the provided options.

  ## Options

  - `type: :directed | :undirected`, specifies what type of graph this is. Defaults to a `:directed` graph.
  - `vertex_identifier`: a function which accepts a vertex and returns a unique identifier of said vertex.
    Defaults to `Multigraph.Utils.vertex_id/1`, a hash of the whole vertex utilizing `:erlang.phash2/2`.
  - `multigraph: true | false`, enables edge indexing for efficient partition-based edge retrieval.
      - When `true`, an `edge_index` is maintained that maps partition keys to sets of edge keys.
      - When `false` (default), no additional memory is used for the index.
  - `partition_by`: a function which accepts an `%Edge{}` and returns a list of unique identifiers used as the partition keys.
    Defaults to `Multigraph.Utils.by_edge_label/1`, which partitions edges by the label when multigraphs are enabled.

  ### Multigraph Edge Indexing

  When `multigraph: true` is enabled the `partition_by` function maintains sets of edges for the partition.
  This option enables a space for time trade-off for Map access retrieval partitioned edges of a kind i.e. [multigraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigraph) capabilities.

  This edge adjacency index can be useful for graphs where many different kinds of edges exist between the same vertices and
  iteration over all edges is prohibitive.

  Converts the given Multigraph to DOT format, which can then be converted to
  a number of other formats via Graphviz, e.g. `dot -Tpng out.dot > out.png`.

  If labels are set on a vertex, then those labels are used in the DOT output
  in place of the vertex itself. If no labels were set, then the vertex is
  stringified if it's a primitive type and inspected if it's not, in which
  case the inspect output will be quoted and used as the vertex label in the DOT file.

  Gets the shortest path between `a` and `b`.

  also considers a heuristic function for determining the lower bound of the cost to go from vertex

  it will do more harm than good. Dijkstra's algorithm can be reframed as A* where `lower_bound(v)` is always 0.

  This function puts the heuristics in your hands, so you must provide the heuristic function, which should take
  a single parameter, `v`, which is the vertex being currently examined. Your heuristic should then determine what the
  lower bound for the cost to reach `b` from `v` is, and return that value.

  returns false. For each vertex in the returned list, no out-neighbors occur earlier in the list. This differs
  from `topsort/1` in that this function returns a list of lists where each sublist can be concurrently evaluated
  without worrying about elements in the sublist depending on eachother.

  Multiple edges between two vertices are considered a single edge for purposes of this sort.
